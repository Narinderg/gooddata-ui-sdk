Thu, 11 Mar 2021 10:47:16 GMT

### Updates

- The ThemeProvider component is no longer in beta and is considered stable.
- DashboardView, a component for embedding dashboards created in KPI Dashboards, is added in the beta stage.
- The capability to validate URLs against an organizationâ€™s whitelist is added to the backend. Currently, the implementation supports only the sdk-backend-bear package backend. The sdk-backend-tiger package backend considers all validation requests valid. The responses from the backend are cached by the decorated caching backend layer.

### Updates

- The dateFormat property from a BaseVisualization is passed to the definition of an IPreparedExecution and is transformed in the BearDataView so that the dates in the AFM execution response can be displayed in the desired format.
- The catalog-export tool generates comprehensive DateDataset mapping.
- ESM builds are added to allow the bundlers supporting them to employ tree shaking and reduce the size of the bundles.
- The sdk-ui-theme-provider library containing the ThemeProvider component is added. The component fetches the selected theme object, parses it, and injects the generated CSS variables into the document body to theme the wrapped application.
- The date format settings are loaded from the backend to the InsightView component.
- A tooltip is added to the value of a ranking filter.
- The date format option is added to the Date Filter component.
- Hook alternatives for the Execute component (useCancelablePromise, useDataView, useExecution, and useDataExport) are added.
